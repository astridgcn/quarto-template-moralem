Thanks to my dear friend [Mael Delem](https://github.com/m-delem), I finally started using quarto, and what a *blast*.

Anyway, I first fell in love with the bootswatch [minty theme](https://bootswatch.com/minty/), then I discovered [Ben Ewing](https://improperprior.com)'s *pastel* template, and I **had** to make it my own.

Btw, there *will* be better versions.
